Qutopia is a lightweight 2D web-playable game built with Unity that focuses on simple mechanics, interactive learning, and smooth gameplay.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a fully playable game experience from concept to deployment, including integration with external web systems.

## 🔐 Web Login Integration (Key Feature)

Qutopia includes a lightweight web-based login system designed to connect the game with an external database.

**How it works:**

- Players log in using their **NIS (Student ID)** before starting the game.
- If the NIS is registered in the web system, the game automatically retrieves and displays the player's name.
- If the NIS is not registered, the game still allows access and displays the entered ID.
- Player data is stored in the web system, enabling persistent tracking.

> This feature highlights my ability to integrate gameplay with external web services and handle real-time data communication between a game client and a backend system.

## 📌 About The Project

Qutopia combines casual gameplay with educational elements while maintaining lightweight performance and clean architecture.

Developed as my **final academic project (thesis)**, this game was built independently — covering the full development lifecycle from planning to deployment.

Through this project, I applied practical game development skills including:

- Gameplay programming  
- Scene management  
- UI implementation  
- Web system integration  
- Asset integration  
- Designing simple and intuitive mechanics
